## Contributions

Suggestions and improvements for this task view are very welcome and can be made
through [issues](https://github.com/cran-task-views/Tracking/issues/new/choose)
or pull requests here on GitHub or via e-mail to the maintainer address. For
further details see the
[Contributing](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/Contributing.md)
guide. All contributions must adhere to the [code of
conduct](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/CodeOfConduct.md).

To be more inclusive we allow submissions from any kind of R package not just
CRAN specific packages. There are two major rules for submissions:

1. Package must exist somewhere publicly accessible online or through the R
   console.
2. Package must pass all CRAN checks (i.e. `R CMD CHECK`). Details on how we run
   our checks can be found [here](checks/).


## Releases

Upon submission of a new package, maintainers of the Tracking CTV discuss if the
package fits the definition of a tracking package (scope criteria).  Submitted
packages from CRAN and Bioconductor that are in the scope of the Tracking CTV
are added as and when in a **rolling release**. Other packages go through a more
thorough range of tests (technically `R CMD CHECK`) and are added in a **checked
version** when the tests are actually run, which we normally do twice a year.

Our current suite of potential packages can be found in
[checks/Tracking_tbl.csv](checks/Tracking_tbl.csv) and the outputs from CRAN
checks can be found at
[checks/Checked_packages.csv](checks/Checked_packages.csv).  You can also follow
the summaries of all changes at [NEWS.md](NEWS.md)
