## CRAN Task View: Processing and Analysis of Tracking Data

**URL:** <https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Tracking>

**Source file:** [Tracking.md](Tracking.md)

**Contributions:** Suggestions and improvements for this task view are very
welcome and can be made through
[issues](https://github.com/cran-task-views/Tracking/issues/new/choose) or pull
requests here on GitHub or via e-mail to the maintainer address. For further
details see the
[Contributing](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/Contributing.md)
guide. All contributions must adhere to the [code of
conduct](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/CodeOfConduct.md).

To be more inclusive we allow submissions from any kind of R package not just
CRAN specific packages. There are two major rules for submissions:

1. Package must exist somewhere publicly accessible online or through the R
   console.
2. Package must pass all CRAN checks (i.e. `R CMD CHECK`). Details on how we run
   our checks can be found [here](checks/).

We normally update the Tracking CTV **twice** a year, roughly January and
July. At that moment we discuss if a package fits the definition of a tracking
package, run checks on all packages, and update the Tracking CTV.

Our current suite of potential packages can be found in
[checks/Tracking_tbl.csv](checks/Tracking_tbl.csv) and the outputs from CRAN
checks can be found at
[checks/Checked_packages.csv](checks/Checked_packages.csv).  You can also follow
the summaries of all changes at [NEWS.md](NEWS.md)
